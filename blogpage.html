        <p>
            My name is <strong>Rishvic Pushpakaran</strong>. I love programming, proficient (kind of) in <em>C++</em>.
            I started programming by doing <em>Competitive Programming</em>, but now am interested in learning <abbr
                title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript, and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
            to make <em>good-looking websites</em>. I think that everyone should know atleast a bit of programming,
            even though programming may have nothing to do with their occupation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's list out the programmming languages I know:-
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li><em>Brainf*ck</em></li>
            <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> & <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ol>

            I especially want to bring your attention to this quote by Linus Torvalds:
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds#2000-04">
            Talk is cheap. Show me the code.<br>
            <span style="padding-left: 15%;">- Linus Torvalds</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I like this quote a lot, because it reflects a <strong>major</strong> aspect of programming. Even if we
            think we know the perfect way to tackle a problem in programming, however perfect we may think it is, it is
            the code implementation that finally matters. <em>We can never know how hard the code implementation is
                without trying to implement it.</em> This is <em>concisely</em> said in his quote.
